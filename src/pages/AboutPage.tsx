                                <p>Ten years ago, seeking a new challenge, I embarked on a path into web development, starting with <a href="https://code-you.org/programs/code-louisville/">Code Louisville's</a>&nbsp;pioneering second cohort where I completed training in both front-end and back-end (C#) technologies. This foundation has allowed me to contribute to projects across diverse sectors, from healthcare and internet services to talent acquisition and e-commerce.  Due to a recent company restructuring, I'm now available to join a new and innovative team.

                                <p>I'm driven by a commitment to crafting high-quality digital experiences, a process I approach with a dedicated passion for problem-solving. This involves a focus on creating intuitive and user-centric experiences that are both delightful and empowering, developing high-performing and scalable solutions that clients can be proud to own, and writing clean, efficient, and easily maintainable code that promotes seamless collaboration within development teams.
                                </p>

                            <div className="div3"><h2>What I'm looking for</h2>
                                <p>I find great satisfaction in various aspects of front-end development, including problem-solving and creating compelling user interfaces. I'm proficient in React and appreciate the business value that Shopify brings to clients. Driven by curiosity and a desire for continuous learning, I'm seeking an opportunity to enhance my skills within a collaborative environment that values knowledge sharing, quality product development, innovation, and a culture of mutual respect.</p>

                                <p>I value a healthy work-life balance and enjoy disconnecting from screens by exploring the natural beauty of my surroundings. Living in an area with abundant land and water trails, as well as beautiful beaches, provides ample opportunities for outdoor activities. Whether it's hiking, kayaking, cycling, or simply relaxing with a book or podcast, I appreciate the distinct seasonsâ€”from cozy winters spent cooking, crafting, and reading, to glorious summers filled with outdoor adventures with my family and dogs.</p>
